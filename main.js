ðŸ‘‰ Write your kata here!

You're making your weekly trip to Tesco for a food shop! We're in the year 3008 and now machines
are running the world and they can only understand numbers... You've created a shopping list which 
consists of numbers which represent specific food items. 

You're trying to be healthy so you decide you only want to buy the fruit that you've put on your 
shopping list. All fruitsitems are represented by a number ending with a 3. Return a new
shopping list with only the fruit items. 

Examples: 

[136453, 353543, 763543, 875654, 121, 373, 2, 14, 3] => [136453, 353543, 763543, 373, 3]
[16745, 37, 863, 233, 1, 22562, 753, 986432, 173] => [863, 233, 753, 173]
